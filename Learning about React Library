Progress:
1). I started learning React Library.
2). Learning the basics of JSX.
3).Studied the rules about creating component functions.

Note:
1). JSX allows writing HTML-like syntax directly inside JavaScript.
2). Function components must start with a uppercase (e.g., App, Header).
3). Components are reusable, which make code more modular and easier to maintain.
