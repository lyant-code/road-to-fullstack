Road to full-stack resolution:
-Starting today, I will stay consistent and disciplined in learning programming.
-Strive to build small or large projects at least once a week.
-Give my best so that within 6â€“12 months, I can become a junior full-stack web developer.
-Build my own portofolio website.
-Collaborating with experts who can push me to be better at programming.
